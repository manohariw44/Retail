He says they are all fabricating their accounts and telling lies,\" said Mrs Hale.\nThe prosecutor claimed Mr Bates invited one 15 year old to his home offering him the chance to look at cine films made at scout camps but then showed him pornographic films.\nShe told the jury that the boy was then sexually abused leaving him confused and frightened.\nMrs Hale said: \"The complainant's recollection is that on a number of occasions sexual acts would happen with the defendant either in the defendant's car or in his cottage.\"\nShe told the jury a second boy was taken by Mr Bates for a weekend in London at the age of 13 or 14 and after visiting pubs he was later sexually abused.\nMrs Hale said two boys from the Spalding group had also made complaints of being sexually abused.\nThe jury has been told that Mr Bates was in the RAF before serving as a Lincolnshire Police officer between 1976 and 1983.\nThe trial, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.",

They have the style of football. They have young English players. Our experience last season shows it is really tough to beat them.\n\"They are really uncomfortable to play against.\n\"I am pretty sure, even if they will not say it loud, the people who know the Premier League know Tottenham are definitely a competitor for the title.\"",

We will try to give them a hard time.\"\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\nThe 24-year-old said: \"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\n\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\"\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\"\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\", adding: \"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\"\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\nTodt said he was \"optimistic\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\n\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\" Rosberg said. \"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\"\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\nBahrain GP qualifying results\nBahrain GP coverage details"

    "In few-shot learning tasks, you give the model an instruction, a few query-response examples of how to follow that instruction, and then a new query.  The model must generate the response for that new query.  This technique has pros and cons: it is very powerful and allows models to be reused for many more applications, but it can be finicky and require significant prompt engineering to get good and reliable results.\n",

However, you will see how few-shot learning allows us to specify custom labels, whereas the previous model was tuned for a specific set of labels.  We will also show other (toy) tasks at the end.  In terms of the Hugging Face `task` specified in the `pipeline` constructor, few-shot learning is handled as a `text-generation` task.\n",

       "It took 24 minutes for a disjointed game to produce a try as Sarel Pretorius sniped from close range and Landman forced his way over for Jason Tovey to convert - although it was the lock's last contribution as he departed with a chest injury shortly afterwards.\n",
       "Glasgow struck back when Fusaro drove over from a rolling maul on 35 minutes for Clegg to convert.\n",
       "But the Dragons levelled at 10-10 before half-time when Naiyaravoro was yellow-carded for an aerial tackle on Brew and Tovey slotted the easy goal.\n",

         "Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\".\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \"did a good job and I didn't\".\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\nVettel said: \"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\"\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\nThe 24-year-old said: \"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\n\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\"\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\"\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\", adding: \"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\"\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\nTodt said he was \"optimistic\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\n\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\" Rosberg said. \"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\"\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\nBahrain GP qualifying results\nBahrain GP coverage details",

       "After the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\n",
       "But Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\n",
       "Vettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\n",

       "She told the jury a second boy was taken by Mr Bates for a weekend in London at the age of 13 or 14 and after visiting pubs he was later sexually abused.\n",

       "Home coach Gregor Townsend gave a debut to powerhouse Fijian-born Wallaby wing Taqele Naiyaravoro, and centre Alex Dunbar returned from long-term injury, while the Dragons gave first starts of the season to wing Aled Brew and hooker Elliot Dee.\n",
       "Glasgow lost hooker Pat McArthur to an early shoulder injury but took advantage of their first pressure when Rory Clegg slotted over a penalty on 12 minutes.\n",
       "It took 24 minutes for a disjointed game to produce a try as Sarel Pretorius sniped from close range and Landman forced his way over for Jason Tovey to convert - although it was the lock's last contribution as he departed with a chest injury shortly afterwards.\n",
       "Glasgow struck back when Fusaro drove over from a rolling maul on 35 minutes for Clegg to convert.\n",
       "But the Dragons levelled at 10-10 before half-time when Naiyaravoro was yellow-carded for an aerial tackle on Brew and Tovey slotted the easy goal.\n",
       "The visitors could not make the most of their one-man advantage after the break as their error count cost them dearly.\n",
       "It was Glasgow's bench experience that showed when Mike Blair's break led to a short-range score from teenage prop Fagerson, converted by Clegg.\n",
       "Debutant Favaro was the second home player to be sin-binned, on 63 minutes, but again the Warriors made light of it as replacement wing Bulumakau, a recruit from the Army, pounced to deftly hack through a bouncing ball for an opportunist try.\n",
       "The Dragons got back within striking range with some excellent combined handling putting Hewitt over unopposed after 72 minutes.\n",

         "summarize: Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\".\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \"did a good job and I didn't\".\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\nVettel said: \"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\"\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\nThe 24-year-old said: \"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\n\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\"\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\"\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\", adding: \"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\"\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\nTodt said he was \"optimistic\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\n\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\" Rosberg said. \"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\"\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\nBahrain GP qualifying results\nBahrain GP coverage details"
